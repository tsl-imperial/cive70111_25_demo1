# CIVE70111 Machine Learning Library

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use GitHub to make contributions collaboratively.

## Instructions

1. **Create your website using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)**
   - Sign in with your GitHub account.
   - Follow the steps to generate a personal website.
   - Copy your website's external link (e.g., `https://yourname.lovable.dev`).

2. **Fork this repository**
   - Click the **Fork** button (top right) to make your own copy.

3. **Create a new branch**
   - In your fork, open the branch selector (default is `main`) and click **View all branches**.
   - Click the **New branch** button and type a new branch name, e.g., `yourname-website`.
   - Press **Enter** to create it.

4. **Make the changes**
   - Open `GALLERY.md` **in your fork**.
   - Click the ✏️ **Edit** button.
   - Add your name and website link at the bottom of the list, for example:

     ```markdown
     ## Your Name

     [Website Name](https://website_name.lovable.app/)

     Your website description
     ```

5. **Commit your change**
   - Scroll down to the **Commit changes** box.
   - Enter a descriptive message, e.g., `Add my website link to gallery (your name)`.
   - Click **Commit changes**.

6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
   - GitHub will prompt you to open a PR after committing.
   - Click **Compare & pull request**.
   - Confirm the base repository (this repo) and base branch (`main`).
   - Write a short description, e.g., `Add my website link to gallery (your name)`.
   - Click **Create pull request**.

✅ By completing this, you'll have practised the full GitHub workflow:  
**fork → branch → edit → commit → pull request**
